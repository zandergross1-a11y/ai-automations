New Patients – What to Expect
- Your first visit usually includes a consultation, exam, and any necessary X-rays.
- The doctor will review your findings and go over a recommended treatment plan.
- You’ll have time to ask questions about your goals and any concerns.

⸻

Urgent / Pain Visits
- We do our best to offer same-day or next-day visits for patients in significant pain.
- If you’re experiencing severe pain, sudden weakness, loss of bladder/bowel control, or symptoms after a serious injury, you should seek emergency medical care first.

⸻

Short-Term Pain Relief (Before an Appointment)
- Some patients use over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen for temporary relief if it is safe for them to do so.
- Gentle movement, light stretching (if comfortable), and ice or heat packs can sometimes help.
- This is not a substitute for an exam, and we always recommend consulting a healthcare professional about any medication questions.
