COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: Are you accepting new patients?
A: Yes, we are currently accepting new patients. We recommend calling the office to confirm availability and get scheduled.

Q: Do I need X-rays?
A: The doctor will decide if X-rays are needed after your initial consultation and exam. Not every patient needs X-rays.

Q: Do you see kids or families?
A: Yes, we do see children and families. The doctor can adjust the techniques used based on age, comfort level, and specific needs.

Q: What should I expect at my first visit?
A: First visits usually include a consultation, a full history, and an exam. In many cases, you’ll receive your first adjustment the same day, unless the doctor feels additional imaging or tests are needed first.

Q: How often will I need to come in?
A: This depends on your specific condition and goals. Some people need more frequent care at first and then move to maintenance visits. The doctor will review a plan with you before you commit to anything.

Q: Do you take insurance?
A: Insurance details can vary, so the best next step is to contact the office directly. The team can check your benefits and let you know what to expect before you come in.

Q: Do you offer cash or self-pay options?
A: Yes, many patients choose to pay out of pocket. The office can explain current pricing and any available payment options.

Q: Can you help with long-term or chronic pain?
A: Many patients with long-term pain do see improvement with chiropractic care, but results vary by person. The doctor will review your history and exam findings and talk honestly about what is realistic for you.
